JavaScript library for the HTML5 slider element

### Ð¡apability Lib
This library allows, in addition to basic config files like the minimum, maximum and current values, it allows you to configure:
- step size
- vertical / horizontal view
- single value or interval,
- the ability to change the value of the "outside" javascript,
- the ability to enable / disable an element above the slider, which shows the value and which crawls behind the mouse (when you turn off, just round the slider itself, when turned on, the element with the number is on).
